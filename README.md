# Machine-Learning-Fruit-Classifier-Python

In this project, we explored and compare multiple machine learning models, to effectively solve the problem of image classification for fruit images. Initially, we explored how utilizing Principal Component Analysis on RGB color pixels, could generate more informative features from the Google Downloaded Dataset, which was formulated by downloading several images of fruits within the categories of apple, banana, guava, mango, orange and pineapple. The results from the Principal Component Analysis indicated that changing the feature space of the RGB color pixels, did in fact increased the overall performance of the based line K-Nearest Neighbor model. Previous image classification work did show that utilizing data augmentation, would in fact increase modelsâ€™ accuracy and it is for that reason that we explored how effective blurring, flipping (both vertically and horizontally), adding contrast, adding noise and gamma filters would be on this fruit dataset. Finally, we explored which neural network architecture (i.e. Dense Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, Pre-Trained CNN) when trained on this fruit dataset, gave the best performance on the validation set and then used the best neural network model to train on the entire training set with data augmentation and evaluate on the test set.
